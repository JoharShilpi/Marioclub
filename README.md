                   credited for debugging, testing, and, most commonly, are listed under 
                   the special thanks. The Mario Club lists its official name as Mario Club, 
                   Inc.For many years they were a debugging team within Nintendo, but in July of 2009 they officially became a subsidiary. As of September 2023, they have 363 employees. Nintendo fully owns the Mario Club and its president is Masanori Okazaki.
